# In this script: (chatgpt)
# 1. Replace `process1_command` and `process2_command` with the actual commands you want to run for each process.
# 2. The processes are started in the background using `&`.
# 3. The PIDs of the processes are stored in variables for later reference.
# 4. A `trap` is set to catch the `SIGINT` signal (Ctrl+C) and call the `stop_processes` function to stop the processes.
# 5. The `stop_processes` function sends the `SIGTERM` signal to each process using the `kill` command.
# 6. The `wait` command is used to wait for the processes to finish before exiting the script.
